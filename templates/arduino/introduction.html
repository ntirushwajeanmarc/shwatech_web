<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
Arduino is an open-source platform used for building electronics projects.<br>
Arduino consists of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller) and a piece of software, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on your computer, used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.<br>
The Arduino platform has become quite popular with people just starting out with electronics, and for good reason.<br>
Unlike most previous programmable circuit boards, the Arduino does not need a separate piece of hardware (called a programmer) in order to load new code onto the board -- you can simply use a USB cable. Additionally, the Arduino IDE uses a simplified version of C++, making it easier to learn to program.<br>
Finally, Arduino provides a standard form factor that breaks out the functions of the micro-controller into a more accessible package.
